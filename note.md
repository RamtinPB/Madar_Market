- [] fix category and sub category for CatSubcatManager
  [text](plans/architecture/backend-category-subcategory-structure.md)

- [] upgrade prisma schema

  check with chatgpt if the plan changes only what is in schema.prisma or if it alters anything else, because from my understanding you program the schema.prisma and migrate it via command line and the rest is not to be touched (only the schema was altered).

  send new refactor plan to chatgpt for examination

alright, here is the new plan, please review it and check if everything is there and up to industry standard (remember that kilo will use this plan to alter the prisma schema):
