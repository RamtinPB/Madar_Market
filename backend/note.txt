    2.  copy database url to the .env file

    // if using local postgres server and database start from here
    3.  npx prisma migrate dev
    4.  npx prisma generate
    5.  bun run dev

// category, sub categories, products schema
i need your help writing this structure for the backend of my project:
context: im using bun + elysia + prisma + postgres + typescript
what i have implemented: a refresh and access JWT system where users also having roles such as USER or SUPER_ADMIN.
what i want:
1. i want to implement this new structure: there will be categories, which host an image, a title, and an order (the super admin will upload the images and edit other content). in addition, each category will also have sub categories, which host a title, and an order (same mechanic for the super admin). in addition to that, each sub category will also have multiple products, these products will each have multiple images--each product image will have an order. the products will also host a title, a description, a discount (a number will be displayed as a percentage), a price, a discounted price, and a sponsor price.
2. i want to professionally and correctly create these backend routes:
/categories/getAll (get all categories)
/categories/:categoryId/getAll (get all subcategories associated with that category)
/categories/:categoryId/:subCategoryId/getAll (get all products associated with that sub category)

the super admin (only the super admin) should also be able to:
1. add/edit/delete the categories data
2. add/edit/delete the sub categories data
3. add/edit/delete the products data

i have this idea for the add/edit/delete:
/admin/categories/:categoryId/add (may not require the categoryId) or edit or delete
/admin/categories/:categoryId/:subCategoryId/add (may not require the categoryId) or edit or delete
/admin/categories/:categoryId/:subCategoryId/:productId/add (may not require the categoryId) or edit or delete

note that add will simply make an empty item. it will be filled through the edit option.

however, on further thought, i think maybe it doesnt have to be specific like this "...:categoryId/:subCategoryId/:productId...". if the association is there then we could just call that specific product or sub category or category. they are already linked.

these are the ideas i have, what is your recommendation for implementing this like a professional project.

p.s. i will store the images in the public folder in the backend (in a structured way with each image having being placed in its appropriate folder and given a relevant name if possible).
